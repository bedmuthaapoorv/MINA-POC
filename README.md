## 🚀 Our Optimization Blueprint:

While LightCert4IoTs is revolutionary, we've pinpointed areas for enhancement. Here's our action plan:

1. **Transition to MINA Protocol** 🔄:
   - Instead of Ethereum 2.0, why not tap into MINA, dubbed the "world's smallest blockchain"?
   - Aims: Enhanced computational efficiency, transaction economy, and reduced storage/memory overheads.

2. **Hashing Technique Overhaul** 🔗:
   - Integrate Zeyad A. Al-Odat's 2020 "Efficient Lightweight Cryptography Hash Function".
   - Expected Perks: Speedier and leaner hashing operations.

3. **Homegrown Random Number Generation** 🎲:
   - Moving away from the external oracle service, Provable.
   - Crafting our in-built random number gen system for bolstered security and nimbleness.

4. **Caching in LRA** 🚀:
   - Introducing cache systems in Local Registration Authorities (LRA) – our edge devices.
   - Goal: Swift authentication and slashing redundant, pricey blockchain pings.
